#Binary cards game template

This is a binary cards game template used by The Gazette and KCRG. It can be used for true/false or yes/no questions, or any other binary results (e.g., on/off, negative/positive, 0/1, Dem/GOP, red/blue values).

To use, create a new folder in the projects directory and copy over the CSS, IMAGES (if images will be used), JS, JSON directories and the index.html file. 

Descriptive comments are included in all files and comments typed as ALL CAPS in the JS and index.html files indicate places for replacement strings or numeric values. 

JSON data is used for the card contents. All styles are within the CSS folder.
